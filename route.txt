route => matching different urls to different ui

means different urls to different react component

when one of those specific urls get visited the corresponding react component will be rendered

React Router => is third party package helped us to route some urls to some ui react component

in react we need third party, but in other frameworks we don't need any third party

Routing allows us to build single-page-application

Application that is executed entirely on the client (browsers)

when the user clicks on a router link, URL is changed

changing a url will then trigger the DOM to be updated as a result

and js (react) and react-router is used to update the page (DOM)

the page is never loaded.

//////////////////////
storing state in url good because
1- easy way to store a state in global place, accessible to all components in the application
2- good way to pass data from one page into the next page without storing the data in a temp place
3- Makes it possible to bookmark and share the page with the exact ui state it had at the time

so URL is an excellent place to store ui state and an alternative to useState in some situations

and to do this we use params or query string

params are good to store data that will be passed to the next page
query string is good for store global state can be used everywhere

to get the data from the url we use as param (useParams) custom hook provided by react router
to get data from url as query string we use (useSearchParams) custom hook provided by react router

useNavigate => a custom hook provided by react router helps to navigate from place to place by using the return from useNavigate which is a function we usually call it navigate

using it inside on click like onClick(()=> navigate('form'))
this will navigate to form

but u can navigate also using declerative way using 
<Navigate />

it's not used that much now but the most use case for it is inside nested Routes
